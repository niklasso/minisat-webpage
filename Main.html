border=0 alt="Trophies"></a> <b><u>MiniSat</u> is a minimalistic, open-source SAT solver,
developed to help researchers and developers alike to get started on SAT.</b>
It is released under the MIT licence, and is currently used in a number of
projects (see "Links").  On this page you will find binaries, sources,
documentation and projects related to <u>MiniSat</u>, including the
Pseudo-boolean solver <u>MiniSat+</u> and the CNF minimizer/preprocessor
<u>SatELite</u>. Together with <u>SatELite</u>, <u>MiniSat</u> was recently
awarded in the three <a href="2nd_stage_all.png">industrial</a> categories and one of the "crafted" categories
of the SAT 2005 competition (see picture).

<p>
Some key features of <u>MiniSat</u>:

<ul>
<li> <b>Easy to modify.</b> <u>MiniSat</u> is small and well-documented,
  and possibly also well-designed, making it an ideal starting
  point for adapting SAT based techniques to domain specific problems.
<li> <b>Highly efficient.</b> Winning all the industrial categories
  of the SAT 2005 competition, <u>MiniSat</u> is a good starting point both for future
  research in SAT, and for applications using SAT.
<li> <b>Designed for integration.</b> <u>MiniSat</u> supports incremental
  SAT and has mechanisms for adding non-clausal constraints. By
  virtue of being easy to modify, it is a good choice for integrating
  as a backend to another tool, such as a model checker or a more
  generic constraint solver.
</ul>

<p>

We would like to start a community to help distribute knowledge about
how to use and modify <u>MiniSat</u>. Any questions, comments,
bugreports, bugfixes etc. should be directed
to <a href="mailto:minisat@googlegroups.com">minisat@googlegroups.com</a>. The
archives can be
browsed <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/minisat"> here</a>. 
The source code repository for MiniSat 2.2 can be found at <a href="http://github.com/niklasso/minisat">github</a>.

<h1>News</h1>
<p> 
<b>From newest to oldest...</b>
<ul>
<li> A <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2021">paper</a> on how to compute localization abstractions using the
     incremental interface of MiniSat. View this as an example of a non-trivial incremental SAT application. A key 
     feature of the algorithm is the use of <i>analyzeFinal()</i> to get the subset of assumptions used 
     in the UNSAT proof.
<li> Finally! A new release of MiniSat, <a href="downloads/minisat-2.2.0.tar.gz">downloads/minisat-2.2.0.tar.gz</a>. 
     For more info, see the <a href="downloads/ReleaseNotes-2.2.0.txt">release notes</a>.
<li> Paper on <a href="downloads/CutSweeping.pdf">Cut-sweeping</a> added, a light-weight alternative to SAT-sweeping 
     useful for preprocessing AIGs before applying SAT.
<li> Added slides for invited talk given by Niklas Een at FMCAD
    (<a href="downloads/PracticalSAT_linux.zip">Linux</a>/<a href="downloads/PracticalSAT_cygwin.zip">Cygwin</a>/<a href="downloads/PracticalSAT_windows.exe">Windows</a>)
<li> Paper on <a href="downloads/synth_in_sat.pdf">efficient CNF generation</a> added (<a href="downloads/SAT07-Een.pdf">slides</a> also available).
<li> Bug-fix in MiniSat+ for trivially unsatisfiable instances.
<li> MiniSat v.2.0 has been released.
<li> Bug-fix to the proof-logging version of MiniSat (thanks to Georg Weißenbacher for reporting the problem!).
<li> Bug-fix to the C-version of MiniSat.
<li> Paper on MiniSat+ added. 
<li> Removed version 1.13 of MiniSat. It was an intermediate version that apperently was buggy.
<li> Patch for Visual Studio users added.
<li> Buggy v1.13 Cygwin binary replaced with working v1.14 binary. The bug did not affect the Linux version.
<li> Fixed the output of MiniSat+ so that it is flushed properly when stdout is redirected to a file.
<li> Fixed a silly bug in MiniSat that caused it to crash on the empty SAT problem if a random variable was picked by the branching heuristic.
<li> Added slides for the invited talk given by Niklas Sörensson at ESCAR (under Papers).
<li> A C version of <u>MiniSat v1.14</u> released.
<li> The cleaned up version <u>v1.14</u> of the competing solver released, now including proof logging.
<li> Source code for <u>MiniSat</u> v1.13 and <u>SatELite</u> 1.0, competing in SAT 2005 released.
<li> The PB solver <u>MiniSat+</u> v0.99 released.
<li> <u>MiniSat</u> and <u>SatELite</u> won the industrial categories of the SAT 2005 competition.
<li> All <u>MiniSat</u> related information finally collected into a web page.
