<p>
<u>MiniSat+</u> is a two-week hack done to enable <u>MiniSat</u> to compete in the new categories
of the SAT 2005 competition. Initially, we intended to support both Pseudo-Boolean constraints
(i.e. linear constraints over boolean variables) and circuit based SAT input (as opposed to
CNF). However, after we finished the conversion of PB-constraints to SAT, we ran out of steam and
never finished the other part.

<p>
However, the PB part is, arguably, the more interesting one. A number of generalizations
of SAT solvers to PB solvers have been proposed (<a
href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~hsheini/pueblo/">Pueblo</a>, 
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~donald/pubs/">Galena</a>, <a
href="http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/units/ag2/software/opbdp/">OPBDP</a> and <a href="http://www.cirl.uoregon.edu/PBLIB/">more</a>),
but we felt that the other approach &#8212; converting the problem to SAT &#8212; had not been
invesigated adequately. Our hope was to provide a point of reference for the proper generalizations
of SAT to PB, so that the merit of such an approach could be evaluated. Therefore
<u>MiniSat+</u> provides multiple ways of translating PB constraints to clauses.

<p>
For the <a href="http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/PB05/">PB evaluation 2005</a>, we provided a top-level heuristic to choose between the 
translation methods. To our surprise, <u>MiniSat+</u> solved more problem than any of the other
6 dedicated PB solvers did, and also seemed to one of the few solvers not being visibly buggy
(modulo giving the wrong exitcode for SATISFIABLE instances without
an objective function).
